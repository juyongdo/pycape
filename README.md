**cape-ds** is a set of Python modules for interacting with your Cape data. Using cape-ds, you can:

- Create and query dataviews, or pointers to the data that you want to use to train a model using Cape's encrypted learning protocol.
- Submit and track jobs.

## Short Tutorial
Access your Cape projects by creating a instance of the main `Cape` class:
``` 
    from cape import Cape

    c = Cape()
    c.login()

    my_projects = c.list_projects()
```

Add dataviews to your project, review dataviews added by other organizations working in the project, and submit your job.
```    
    from cape import DataView, VerticallyPartitionedLinearRegression

    data_view = DataView(name="my-data", uri="s3://my-data.csv" owner_label="my-org")
    my_project = c.get_project("project_123")
    my_project.create_dataview(data_view)

    dvs = my_project.list_dataviews()

    vlr_job = VerticallyPartitionedLinearRegression(
        train_dataview_x=dvs[0],
        train_dataview_y=dvs[1]
    )

    my_project.submit_job(vlr_job)
```
